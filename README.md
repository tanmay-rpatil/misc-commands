## Clean up older verions of snaps

Source [ItsFoss-Free-Up-Space](https://itsfoss.com/free-up-space-ubuntu-linux/)

Snaps store previous versions of the apps, which may take up loads of storage space.
Check amount of space taken up by snaps

```bash
du -h /var/lib/snapd/snaps  
```

- Save the following script, ( source the above article ) as a shell script file ( say clean.sh )

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Removes old revisions of snaps
# CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
    while read snapname revision; do
        snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
    done
```

- Give the file execution permission, then execute it as superuser 

```bash
chmod +x ./clean.sh #gave execute permission

sudo ./clean.sh #execute it
```

## Evince (Document vievwer fails to open links when chrome is the default browser) ðŸ“š

The error message it dumps is along the lines of 

```bash
    [11589:11589:1118/193800.293444:FATAL:double_fork_and_exec.cc(131)] execv /opt/google/chrome/chrome_crashpad_handler: Permission denied (13)
```

To fix it, we need to edit ```/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/ubuntu-helpers``` as root

```bash
# can replace nano with the text editor of your choice, such as gedit or vim
sudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/ubuntu-helpers 
```

inside profile_sanitized_helper{} insert the following line:

```   /opt/google/chrome/chrome_crashpad_handler Pixr, ```

```bash
# reload
cd /etc/apparmor.d
sudo apparmour_parser -r usr.bin.evince
```

## Uninstall Apps ðŸ“²

```bash
#this if for disros using apt/dpkg
dpkg -list
dpkg -l
apt-get â€“-purge remove #Name
apt-get --purge remove #Name
sudo apt-get --purge remove #Name
```

## Nvidia Screen Tearing fixes ðŸ–¥

[NVIDIA/Troubleshooting/#Screen-Tearing - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting#Avoid_screen_tearing)

In /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf Insert the following Lines as a root user
Read the above arch wiki article for details and steps!

```
Section "Device"
        Identifier "Nvidia Card"
        Driver     "nvidia"
        VendorName "NVIDIA Corporation"
        BoardName  "GeForce GTX 1050 Ti"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier     "Screen0"
    Device         "Device0"
    Monitor        "Monitor0"
    Option         "MetaModes" "nvidia-auto-select +0+0 {ForceFullCompositionPipeline=On}"
    Option         "AllowIndirectGLXProtocol" "off"
    Option         "TripleBuffer" "on"
EndSection
```

###### This is the startup command that I added instead of the above fix

```bash
nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode="DPY-0: nvidia-auto-select +0+0 {ForceCompositionPipeline=On}"
```

## Ram Speed Check

```bash
sudo dmidecode --type 17
# alternative 
sudo lshw -C memory
```

## Spicetify Setup ðŸŽ¶

Few steps to setup Spicetify on the Flatpak version of the Spotify client. For documentation check [GitHub - khanhas/spicetify-cli: Commandline tool to customize Spotify client. Supports Windows, MacOS and Linux.](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli)

```bash
sudo chmod a+wr /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.spotify.Client/current/active/files/extra/share/spotify
sudo chmod a+wr /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.spotify.Client/current/active/files/extra/share/spotify/Apps -R
alias spicetify="/home/tanmay/spicetify-cli/spicetify" #already done in my system
# replace "tanmay" in the path above with your user name. Make sure it is the path to the spicetify executable in your system
# taking the example of a popular Dribbblish Theme.
cd "$(dirname "$(spicetify -c)")/Themes/DribbblishDynamic"
mkdir -p ../../Extensions
cp dribbblish-dynamic.js ../../Extensions/.
spicetify config extensions dribbblish-dynamic.js
spicetify config current_theme DribbblishDynamic color_scheme dark
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
spicetify apply
```

## Flush DNS Cache

```bash
# check if systemcl is used on your system 
sudo systemctl is-active systemd-resolved.service
# if active: yes in case of ubuntu
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
```
